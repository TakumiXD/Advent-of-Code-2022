### Day 7 part 1
Got stuck because I tried to solve it doing a single linear scan on the input.  
Needed to look on Reddit for help.  

### Day 8
Learned to use  
``
2DArray = [ [ -1 for j in range(COL) ] for i in range(ROW) ]  
``  
over  
``
2DArray = [ [ -1 ] * COL ] * ROW
``

Found the hint on Reddit. 

### Day 12
